27. Which of the following services could be used to deploy an application to servers running on-premises? (Select TWO.)
    - A. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    - B. AWS OpsWorks
    - C. AWS CodeDeploy
    - D. AWS Batch
    - E. AWS X-Ray

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: B, C

    AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates the process of deploying applications to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, or serverless Lambda functions. It supports deploying applications to on-premises servers running in a corporate data center or in a hybrid environment.

    AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. It can be used to automate the deployment of applications, both on AWS resources (EC2 instances) and on-premises servers running in a corporate data center or in a hybrid environment.

    The other options are not suitable for deploying applications to on-premises servers:

    Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications on AWS resources (EC2 instances, load balancers, etc.). It does not support deploying applications directly to on-premises servers.

    AWS Batch is a batch computing service that efficiently runs batch jobs on AWS resources. It does not handle application deployments to on-premises servers.

    AWS X-Ray is a service for tracing and analyzing application performance on AWS resources. It does not have capabilities for deploying applications to on-premises servers.

28. Which Amazon EC2 pricing model adjusts based on supply and demand of EC2 instances?
    - A. On-Demand Instances
    - B. Reserved Instances
    - C. Spot Instances
    - D. Convertible Reserved Instances

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: C

    Explanation:Spot Instances are an Amazon EC2 pricing model that allows customers to bid on spare EC2 computing capacity. The spot price for an instance type fluctuates based on the supply and demand for that instance type in a specific AWS Availability Zone.

    When the demand for an instance type is high, the spot price will increase accordingly. Conversely, when the demand is low, the spot price will decrease, allowing customers to leverage these instances at a significantly lower cost compared to On-Demand or Reserved Instances.

    However, it's important to note that Spot Instances can be interrupted (terminated) by AWS when the spot price exceeds the customer's bid price or when there is a shortage of spare capacity.

    Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

    A. On-Demand Instances: This pricing model allows customers to pay for compute capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments. The price for On-Demand Instances is fixed and does not adjust based on supply and demand.

    B. Reserved Instances: With Reserved Instances, customers can purchase capacity reservations for a specific instance type in a specific Availability Zone for a discounted hourly rate compared to On-Demand pricing. The pricing for Reserved Instances is fixed and does not fluctuate based on supply and demand.

    D. Convertible Reserved Instances: This is a type of Reserved Instance that provides the ability to change the instance type, operating system, or tenancy of the reservation. However, like other Reserved Instances, the pricing is fixed and does not adjust based on supply and demand.

    - Configure security and network access on your Amazon EC2 instance.
    - Choose which instance type(s) you want, then start, terminate, and monitor as many instances of your AMI as needed, using the web service APIs or the variety of management tools provided.
    - Determine whether you want to run in multiple locations, utilize static IP endpoints, or attach persistent block storage to your instances.
    - Pay only for the resources that you actually consume, like instance-hours or data transfer.

36. How would an AWS customer easily apply common access controls to a large set of users?
    - A. Apply an IAM policy to an IAM group.
    - B. Apply an IAM policy to an IAM role.
    - C. Apply the same IAM policy to all IAM users with access to the same workload.
    - D. Apply an IAM policy to an Amazon Cognito user pool.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: A

    Explanation:
    - Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers, accounting, etc.).
    - Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to the group.
    - That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can
    simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

39. Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?
    - A. Implement single points of failure.
    - B. Implement loose coupling.
    - C. Implement monolithic design.
    - D. Implement vertical scaling.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: B

    Explanation:
    - Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them.
    - The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer.
    - This approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency.
    - So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.

40. Which of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Select TWO.)
    - A. Enable AWS CloudTrail.
    - B. Grant least privilege access to IAM users.
    - C. Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
    - D. Enable Amazon CloudFront.
    - E. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: B, E

    Explanation:
    - If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case.
    - This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised.
    - For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.

41. Which service provides a hybrid storage service that enables on-premises applications to seamlessly use cloud storage?
    - A. Amazon Glacier
    - B. AWS Snowball
    - C. AWS Storage Gateway
    - D. Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS)

    <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">Answer</summary>

    Correct Answer: C

    Explanation:
    - AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Customers use Storage Gateway to simplify storage management and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storage use cases.
    - These include moving tape backups to the cloud, reducing on-premises storage with cloud-backed file shares, providing low latency access to data in AWS for on- premises applications, as well as various migration, archiving,
